		<h1>About my school</h1>
		<p><p>Fravashi International Academy has been awarded the 13th position in India, the 3rd position in Maharashtra and the 1st position in Nashik in the year 2019-2020 in the India school rankings by the ‘Education World’. The academic reputation, faculty competence, leadership quality, sports education and interaction with parents, educationists, principals and teachers around the country were the key parameters used to decide the list of fifteen top ranking schools in India. <br> <br> <br> The school has been made by Mr. Ratan Luth who is the Chairman, R. S. Luth Education Trust. He said that "I have always believed that dreams turn into reality only by hard work, as Donovan Bailey has rightly said, “Follow your passion, be prepared to work hard, sacrifice and, above all, don’t let anyone limit your dreams.” An institution is the culmination of the power of a dream and a team. Keeping in mind the need to develop and train children who would be the future global citizens, I decided to introduce to Nashik its very first International day cum boarding school, Fravashi International Academy (FIA). I believe our appeal as a school rests in our strong sense of community, the values and discipline we inculcate, our commitment to realizing the potential of young students, and providing a balanced education that addresses the academic, social, emotional, physical and spiritual aspects of our students’ lives." <br> <br> <br> FIA is the best IGCSE schoool in nashik because of pread majestically in 39.2 acres of lush green land, amidst pure nature, offers an exclusive Cambridge Curriculum in Nashik, ranked amongst the top 10 boarding and day boarding schools in India, No. 2 in Maharashtra and No. 1 in Nashik also it recevied a lot of rewrds! </p> </p>
